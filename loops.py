# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence 
# (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set or a string) (or a custom condition)


people = ['John', 'Paul', 'Sara']

# Simple for loop
for person in people:
    print(f'Current Person is {person}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
